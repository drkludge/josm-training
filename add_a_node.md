## Notes

The Short Cut column in the table describes keyboard sequences in the Procedure sequence table.
  
  * alt- means to hold the alt key and then select another key.
  * ctrl- means to hold the control key and then select another key.
  * shift- means to hold the shift key and then select another key.
  * ctrl-shift- means to hold both of the keys down and then select another key such as a, b, or the mouse scroll button.  You may need to use one or all three of the alt-, ctrl-, shift- keys together.  Using a single key on the keyboard is also a valid command.

The Step Description may have menu sequences in addition to the Short Cut column or a more detailed description as to why the Short Cut is invoked at this point in the procedure.

Generally, the Procecure will expect you to already have OpenStreetMap data downloaded for your area of editing interest.
