GIS is a directory to start in your user directory or at the root of a MS Windows drive.  The idea behind this directory structure:

1. Download the zip archive from github.
2. Unzip the files.
3. Move the GIS folder to c:\gis or a thumb drives root folder.
4. If you move the default location, then change the [josm.cmd](bin/josm.cmd). Change the c: to x: or the location of your thumb drive's location.

This file keeps the folder structure intact.
