# JOSM Training

Yet another OpenStreetMap training seminar.

The JOSM Training repostiory contains the steps that I would use if someone asked me how to learn the Java OpenStreetMap Editor, JOSM.  JOSM Training repository is also the project that I will use for my 90 minute hands on workshop at the 2017 Arizona Geographic Information Council, AGIC, [Education and Training Symposium](https://www.agicsymposium.org/).  The conference abstract reads:

**OpenStreetMap Editing With The JOSM Editor**
 
One tenant from the programming field is to learn a new programming language each year.  The idea behind this annual educational process is that a software developer learns new things that can be taken back to there primary programming language. In the case of GIS, there are several non-ESRI editors available. This hands on workshop will provide an introduction to the design of the OpenStreetMap, OSM, topology.  Then the three OSM web editors--Potlach2, iD, and Level5--will be introduced.  Mobile editors will also be examined.  Finally, the course will deep dive into the Java OSM editor. The JOSM exercises are procedure oriented.  Bring a laptop with a three button mouse: left right buttons with a center scroll wheel.
 
**Prerequisites:** There are no prerequisites. Editing OpenStreetMap is not rocket science. You must be able to install software via zip archives.
 
**Workshop Format:** The workshop will have some lecture and demonstration.  The bulk of the workshop consists of predefined OSM files targeting JOSM feature exploration based on the Author's experience.  After some practice, we will edit the OSM map.
 
A Zipfile from Github includes: setup documentation, lecture presentation, exercise data.

## Other Options

This JOSM workshop is just one of the many training options available.  Here is a short list of sites that provide a spring board into many other topics.  These other resouces may provide another angle on the topics covered in this workshop.

* [Maptime](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/) started out as a way for a group of friends to explore map related technologies.  There a number of maptime chapters across the globe.
* [learnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/) is a step by step guide to learning OpenStreetMap.
* [OpenStreetMap Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a rich place to continue your understanding of OpenStreetMap and related technologies.
* [JOSM Keyboard Shortcuts Cheat Sheet](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/9/99/JOSM_Keyboard_shortcuts_cheat_sheet.png) [Florin Badita's](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/baditaflorin/diary/37606) Telenav Learning Friday project.
* [JOSM Software site](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) provides the editor software but also has a helpful wiki JOSM resources.
* [JOSM OpenStreetMap Wiki Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Guide) provides helpful JOSM resources.
